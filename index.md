## Hi!

My name is **Danial Madson**. I'm a junior developer currently located in South Dakota and looking for work, wherever it may take me.
I think of programming as a method of creative problem solving, with a surprising amount of room for self-expression. 
  
My favorite programming languages are **Javascript**, **Python**, and **C++**. In my free time I love to cook, play guitar, and discover new music.
